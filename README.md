- **Nested Casting**: Automatically handle nested data structures with ease.
- **Recursive Serialization**: Serialize objects recursively for smooth data handling.
- **Validation**: Built-in validation to ensure data integrity before processing.
- **Service Layer Support**: Ideal for service-oriented architectures.
- **Compliant with SOLID Principles**: Promotes maintainable and scalable code.

## Installation

To install the Laravel Argonaut DTO package, you can use Composer. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require astrr3/laravel-argonaut-dto
```

After installation, publish the configuration file if necessary:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Argonaut\ArgonautServiceProvider"
```

This command will publish the configuration file to your `config` directory, allowing you to customize settings as needed.

## Usage

Using Argonaut is straightforward. First, create a DTO class by extending the base `Dto` class provided by Argonaut. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```php
namespace App\Dto;

use Argonaut\Dto;

class UserDto extends Dto
{
    public string $name;
    public string $email;
    public ?string $phone;

    protected function rules(): array
    {
        return [
            'name' => 'required|string|max:255',
            'email' => 'required|email',
            'phone' => 'nullable|string|max:15',
        ];
    }
}
```

### Creating a DTO Instance

You can create an instance of your DTO and validate it easily:

```php
$data = [
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => 'john@example.com',
    'phone' => '1234567890',
];

$userDto = new UserDto($data);

if ($userDto->isValid()) {
    // Proceed with valid data
} else {
    // Handle validation errors
    $errors = $userDto->getErrors();
}
```

## Examples

### Nested DTOs

Argonaut allows you to create nested DTOs for complex data structures. Hereâ€™s an example of a `PostDto` that includes a nested `UserDto`:

```php
namespace App\Dto;

use Argonaut\Dto;

class PostDto extends Dto
{
    public string $title;
    public string $content;
    public UserDto $author;

    protected function rules(): array
    {
        return [
            'title' => 'required|string|max:255',
            'content' => 'required|string',
            'author' => 'required|array',
        ];
    }
}
```

### Recursive Serialization

Argonaut makes it easy to serialize nested DTOs. You can convert your DTO to an array or JSON format effortlessly:

```php
$postDto = new PostDto([
    'title' => 'My First Post',
    'content' => 'This is the content of my first post.',
    'author' => new UserDto(['name' => 'John Doe', 'email' => 'john@example.com']),
]);

$json = $postDto->toJson();
```
